""" contains the different optimizers we can use to refine our learning models

    * ultimately i would want to do some "mixted" optimization. e.g. there's the keras tuner that can already do a lot
    * however, there are insteresting approaches for things like #/types of layers etc... that use say bayesian optim
    * could also wrap some of the optim into numpy's optimizer
    * but that should all come a bit later
