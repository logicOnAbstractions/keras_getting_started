about
---------
* machine learning on a rest api (deprec/removed)
* now building instead a wrapper

usage
--------
* `python main.py` (to launch the server)
* `python comms.py` (runs the api calls with payload

notes
----------
* their `run_keras_server.py` ==> `main.py`. we'll add good naming conventions
* must install tensor flow, check requirements.txt

ideas
---------
* could run on docker. scale up ML side on demand from api
