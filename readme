about
-----------

A good "default" MainProgram. Essentially a wrapper around whatever application we might want. Comes with basic stuff like loading config files, test suite structure we can fill in, etc.

usage
---------

python /server/server.py --configs [config filepath] --mode [one of mode defined in config file]

Both are arguments are optional. By default, we load the "default" mode defined in `configs.yaml` which should be placed
in the project's root directory.

This commands starts the server, which has an instances of MainProgram for configs & details.
Then one can use /server/comms.py to make a call. Eventually the full API/webpage I'll build

NOTE: the default values are always set, regardless of the mode selected. What the other modes do is that they
override any such values with whatever is put there. No need to fully re-defined all attribute if using
a non-default mode.
